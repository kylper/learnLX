## Description
learnLX is an open source platform for learning programming languages.

#### Currently in Alpha!
Much more is left to be completed with learnLX. Check out the GitHub issues section for more info.

## Setting up for Production
*Currently, you need a web interface to use learnLX which has not been completed yet. You will eventually be able to use learnLX on the web, mobile applications, and on command line.*

1. Install the base program
You can do this by downloading the source or using Git command line tools.

2. Update learnLX

The latest dependencies need to be downloaded for learnLX to run properly.

    cd (your project folder)
    npm install

3. Run!

There is a script you need to run to set everything up for the first time.

    [coming soon]

Afterward, to run learnLX, just open the program with this:

    node app.js

**More info on the Web Interface and CLI is coming soon.**
