An open-source language-learning platform.
Created by Kyle Permuy (varNinja).

### Currently in Alpha!
Much more is left to be completed with learnLX. Check out the GitHub issues section for more info.

## Description
Many language-learning platforms implement only the most popular languages to use their resources efficiently, which is an intelligent move for popular services. However, this leaves out languages that people really want to learn but do not have the resources to do so. learnLX is an open source language-learning platform that anyone can use, which takes the middleman out of the picture.

## Setting up for Production
*Currently, you need a web interface to use learnLX which has not been completed yet. You will eventually be able to use learnLX on the web, mobile applications, and on command line.*

1. Install the base program
You can do this by downloading the source or using Git command line tools.

2. Update learnLX

The latest dependencies need to be downloaded for learnLX to run properly.

    cd (your project folder)
    npm install

3. Run!

There is a script you need to run to set everything up for the first time.

    [coming soon]

Afterward, to run learnLX, just open the program with this:

    node app.js

## Editing your Language
After setting up learnLX, you can start the process of adding and editing your language. To access the editing interface, just go to the web interface or the CLI.

**More info on the Web Interface and CLI is coming soon.**

## Using learnLX
As a user, you can access learnLX two centralized ways: web interface and mobile applications that you can use to log on to any learnLX server.
The administrator of the learnLX server you wish to use may also implement their own version of our open-source web interface or apps.
