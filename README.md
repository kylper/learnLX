# learnLX
An open-source language learning platform.

Road-map coming soon.

Here are descriptions of the services:
### Front End
This is how the user accesses the platform. The Front End can access any server that has been deployed successfully and the user has access to. User will be prompted to select a language (or a server if user has selected advanced view), and (if required by the server) an authentication method such as a username/password combo.

### Back End
The Back End API can be deployed at any server.
